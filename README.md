# Car Price Prediction using Data Science and Machine Learning

A Data Science and Machine Learning Project that first performs a broad range of exploratory data analysis and then used different machine learning models to predict the used cars price based on some features/attributes such as review counts, fuel type, transmission type, seating type, body type, maximum torque, maximum power, etc. It is important to know the car actual market price before sell or purchase it.

## About Dataset
This dataset was derived from https://www.cardekho.com/. The dataset consists specifications list as we all rating only for new cars.

## Dataset Description
This dataset consists of 16 features on a total of 203 car choices available in India.

## Data Visualuzation
Applied a wide varities of visualization operations to visualize dataset using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## Data and Setup on the Jupyter Notebook
First, imported all the necessary packages from NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, etc.
Then, read the ‘CARS_1.csv’ file as a dataframe called df.

Some features are string type. I perform data pre-processing operations to convert those features from string to float64 data type.

## Training and Predicting Models
Trained and tested the dataset using Machine Learning Models:
- **Linear Regression** 
- **Random Search Regression**
- **Grid Search Regression**

## Regression Evaluation Metrics
Here are some common evaluation metrics for regression problems:
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)
- Negative Mean Absolute Error (NMAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Root Mean Suared Error (RMSE)

## Hyperparameters Optimization
Optimized hyperparameters using Random Search and Grid Search Regression Algorithms.
